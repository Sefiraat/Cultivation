Cultivation is a Slimefun4 addon that adds a plethora of plants, bushes and trees to Minecraft as well as an amazing food selection to be made via a unique, fully featured, kitchen!
Using 1.19.4's amazing, new, DisplayEntites we are able to display plants and blocks like you've never seen before.

[![Build Status](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/Sefiraat/Cultivation/master/badge.svg)](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/Sefiraat/Cultivation/master)

You can find a fuller guide to Cultivation by reading my [Documentation Pages](https://sefiraat.dev)

Please note, this addon makes use of 1.19.4' display entities which, as the name suggests, are Entities. These entities do not tick and do not add a performance over head to your server however some lag clearing plugins may be set to remove them. Be sure to add **BLOCK_DISPLAY**, **ITEM_DISPLAY** and **TEXT_DISPLAY** to your exclusions list otherwise you may encounter errors within the addon.

## Cultivation Plants

<p align="center"><img width="1355" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/231164447-be56b8b1-cc92-486d-a2ec-97cec27a438d.png"></p>

Plants are Cultivation's resource generating flora. Each plant type will grow vanilla minecraft items periodically.

Plants require crop sticks to be able to grow and, if double-crop-sticked the plants will attempt to breed with nearby plants.
Breeding will either result in a brand new plant type or a stronger version of the mother/father plant(s). Try your best to 10/10/10 a plant to get the most possible drops, growth speed and breed strength.

There are a total of 90 plants to discover via breeding or, if you're struggling to find a combination, Wandering Traders will sell you documents that will help you on your journey.

## Garden Cloche

<p align="center"><img height="300" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/231168642-9208af2b-d40a-4d75-8da8-c8deeed1703e.png"></p>

You can automate the production of Cultivation Plants within the Garden Cloche. While a little slower than manually harvested plants, it will produce constantly and allows Slimefun Cargo and Networks access.

## Cultivation Bushes

<p align="center"><img width="1195" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/231167783-0367929f-be68-476c-8637-de68267b3ed1.png"></p>

Bushes are somewhat simpler than plants, they don't breed nor do they level and their sole purpose is the production of foodstuffs.
Each bush produces a different food item ("Produce") that can be used within our kitchen to make food by-products and eventually crafted into fully cooked meals.

Bushes are bought from Farmer villagers.

## Cultivation Trees

<p align="center"><img width="1108" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/231168164-fa57deee-e4fb-4463-9439-56b729cd4229.png"></p>

Trees will grow into beautiful, custom built, trees bearing supurbly ripe fruits.
Fruits can be plucked off of the tree and used in cooking and smoothie making.
Breaking the tree's leaves has a 20% chance to drop another sapling to be able to replant the tree.

Trees are bought from Fletching Villagers

## The Kitchen!

<img width="1391" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/231169938-c94116a1-2064-4cb1-85e8-2ecd14b6d61e.png">

The Kitchen is where you can cook all your wonderful produce.

Nearly all Cultivation Products (and most Vanilla foods) can be:
- Chopped
- Sliced
- Boiled
- Blended
- Ground
- Fried
- Mashed

Then you can combine your by-products into a meal via:
- Oven Cooking/Baking
- Finishing

Each food item has a custom effect when eaten. Most effects last for 10 whole minutes, but do not allow you to eat again during said 10 mins.

Some foods have custom one-off effects that break this mold.
